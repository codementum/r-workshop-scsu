# Data Modeling

## Modeling - The Big Picture

<img src="data-science-model.png" width="800px" />

## Modeling and You

Oftentimes we're looking for "significance":

- Some consistent effect between two or more groups (t.test, ANOVA, etc)
- An equation that describes a relationship (linear and other forms of modeling)

Where does this fit into your process?

## The approach

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # set of libraries

library(modelr)
options(na.action = na.warn)
```

## Let's model some data

```{r}
ggplot(sim1, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point()
```


## Randomly generating models
```{r}
models <- tibble(
  a1 = runif(250, -20, 40),
  a2 = runif(250, -5, 5)
)

ggplot(sim1, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = a1, slope = a2), data = models, alpha = 1/4) +
  geom_point() 
```


## Applying a model


```{r}
model1 <- function(a, data) {
  a[1] + data$x * a[2]
}
model1(c(7, 1.5), sim1) # an example model's predictions
```

## Your turn

Produce a plot of the model c(7, 1.5) (intercept, slope)

Hint: start by plotting sim1 with points (as above)

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  b = 7,
  y = 1.5
) # remember, y = mx + b

# add ggplot here
```

## One solution

```{r}
ggplot(sim1) + 
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = b, slope = y), data = df) +
  geom_point(aes(x, y))
```



## Model "error"

- "root mean square deviation"

```{r}
measure_distance <- function(mod, data) {
  diff <- data$y - model1(mod, data)
  sqrt(mean(diff ^ 2))
}
measure_distance(c(7, 1.50), sim1) # example model distance (average)
```

## Distance of Multiple Models

```{r}
sim1_dist <- function(a1, a2) {
  measure_distance(c(a1, a2), sim1)
} # using fucntion from before... 

# add "dist" col for each model
models <- models %>% 
  mutate(dist = purrr::map2_dbl(a1, a2, sim1_dist))
models # print results
```

## 10 best models

```{r}
ggplot(sim1, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, colour = "grey30") + 
  geom_abline(
    aes(intercept = a1, slope = a2, colour = -dist), 
    data = filter(models, rank(dist) <= 10)
  )
```

## Visualizing the model space!

```{r}
ggplot(models, aes(a1, a2)) +
  geom_point(data = filter(models, rank(dist) <= 10), size = 4, colour = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(colour = -dist))
```

## Make a grid of models
```{r}
grid <- expand.grid(
  a1 = seq(-5, 20, length = 25),
  a2 = seq(1, 3, length = 25)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(dist = purrr::map2_dbl(a1, a2, sim1_dist))
```

## Plot our grid 
```{r}
grid %>% 
  ggplot(aes(a1, a2)) +
  geom_point(data = filter(grid, rank(dist) <= 10), size = 4, colour = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(colour = -dist)) 
```


## Moving forward

- This was ch 23.1 & 23.2 in R4DS
- The rest of 23 includes: interactions, transformations, etc

# Switching gears -- basic hypothesis testing & estimation

## Iris Sepal Lengths: Are these significantly different?

```{r}
iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = Species, colour = Species), alpha=0.1) 
```

## Running a t.test

```{r}
t.test( filter(iris, Species == "setosa")$Sepal.Length,
        filter(iris, Species == "versicolor")$Sepal.Length) 
```

## Your turn: Running a ???

Run some other test on the data. Maybe change the variables, maybe try a different test (e.g. ANOVA).

Hint: to find other tests, use Google, Stack Overflow and keep an eye out for Quick-R
